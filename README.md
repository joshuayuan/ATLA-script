*ATLA Script Parser*
By Joshua Yuan.

**Inspiration**
Since the 4th grade I've been super into Avatar the Last Airbender. I would rewatch episodes, act out scenes, study the [Avatar Wikia](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar_Wiki). At one point, I discovered [this website](atla.avatarspirit.net/transcripts.php) which had the scripts for all the episodes, and more. This was my new goto website because now I could memorize the quotes precisely. 

A few years ago, I became paranoid that one day the site might go down and I would lose access to the scripts, so I thought of manually copy and pasting the contents into a document, or of manually saving the html, but these were inefficient and excessive actions, so I decided realized the best way would be to write a script to crawl
